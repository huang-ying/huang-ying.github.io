#### Single-cell RNA sequencing unveils the shared and the distinct cytotoxic hallmarks of human TCRVdelta1 and TCRVdelta2 gammadelta T lymphocytes.

Citation: Pizzolato, G., et al.  Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2019;116(24):11906-11915.

Platform: ~13K PBMC in 10x Genomics platform, including PBMC4K and PBMC8K by 3' V2 chemistry in 10X's website 

Note: In their analysis, CD4 and CD8 can only be seperated with a higher resolution parameter, 0.6 -> 1.2
